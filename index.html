    <p>
      On this page you find technical documentation about the ongoing work in
      the ECHORD EduFill experiment as well as a continuously updated demonstration
      of the software developed in Edufill.

        A description of the robotic specific building blocks implemented in 
        EduFill. This also covers the necessary changes to Blockly's core needed
        to implement our compound building blocks.  This is a living document

    <h2>Graphical Programming Demo</h2>
    
    <p>
      Here we present the current state of the EduFill graphical programming system.
      The system is based on the Blockly framework available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blockly/">Blockly Homepage</a>
      Blockly is a framework designed to simplify the creation of web-based 
      graphical programming tools.  Blockly itself only provides the necessary
      infrastructure for building programming systems and is target language
      independent.  For more information visit the Blockly homepage. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      For EduFill's use, we made some changes to Blockly and added EduFill specific
      blocks.  The whole EduFill Software toolbox is composed of three parts:
      <ul>
        <li>The actual programming system, presented on this page</li>
        <li>The Python modules implementing the glue code to combine
        Blockly blocks into a working application</li>
        <li>The functional software components implementing the actual 
        functionality of our EduFill specific Blockly blocks, like 3D 
        object recognition, base navigation, trajectory planning etc.</li>
      </ul>
      The last two parts make up the EduFill runtime environment and form
      a major part of the EduFill software toolbox. 
    </p>

    <h3>The EduFill Graphical Programming Workspace</h3>
        <p>
            EduFill application workspace: <a href="./blockly/createApp/index.html">blockly</a>
        </p>        

    <h3>Tutorials for EduFill's version of Blockly</h3>

    <p>
      We have two tutorials to the EduFill software toolbox:
      <ul>
        <li>A tutorial describing the <a href="Tutorials_Runtime.html">setup of the runtime environment</a>. (optional)</li>
        <li>A short tutorial describing the <a href="Tutorials_Blockly.html">programming system</a>. (recommended reading)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Related Multimedia Material</h2>

        <p>
      We created a few videos demonstrating mobile manipulation tasks.
      <ul>
        <li>Fetch and carry showcase: <a href="video_fetch_and_carry.html">video</a><br/>
        This is the current test case for developing the software toolbox 
        (programming system and runtime environment).</li>
        <li>Simple single-robot assembly: <a href="video_simple_assembly.html">video</a><br />
        This was the initial showcase case for assembly, which served as 
        source of requirements towards the programming system and software
        components.</li>
      </ul>
